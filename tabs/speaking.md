I have spoken to many different audiences, both large and small. Technical speaking is something I enjoy doing. Want me to speak at your **conference**? Or maybe your **user group**? Or even your **company/organization**?

*The topic you want to hear about not in that list of sessions (yet)?* Feel free to suggest what I speak about! Here are my topics I'm willing and capable of creating and delivering a session on:

- Azure
- Kubernetes
- Linux
- DevOps

If your request is about one or more of those topics and I have the bandwidth, we might be able to make it work! Send me an email: [thomas@trstringer.com](mailto:thomas@trstringer.com).
